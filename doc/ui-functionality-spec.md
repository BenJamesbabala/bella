# Functionality of UI

This document described the functionality the user interface should support.

### Displaying Records

### Labeling and Tagging Records

### Filtering records

Users can define filters, also called "views" in database terminology. These views define a query that selects a subset of the data. Users can define their own views using a query language, or use a predefined view.

Predefined views include:

- All records (with a max limit)
- Unlabeled records
- Records were predictionss do not match the label
- Records by tag

### Dataset Evaluation



### Multiple projects
